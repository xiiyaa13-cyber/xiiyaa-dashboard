# xiiyaa.net

Market intelligence, distilled. A clean, dark-mode daily market briefing.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run fetch   # Fetches data → data/briefing.json
npm run build   # Builds index.html from template
npm run update  # fetch + build
```

## Daily auto-update (GitHub Actions)

The workflow runs daily at 6:00 AM UTC and fetches fresh data, then commits and pushes changes.

### Setup

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Add secrets: **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
   - `NEWS_API_KEY` (optional): [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) key for live headlines
3. Without keys, the pipeline still runs using fallback data and the free Fear & Greed API.

### Manual run

Go to **Actions → Daily briefing update → Run workflow**.

## Data sources

| Source | Key required | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Fear & Greed | No | Alternative.me (crypto index, used as proxy) |
| NewsAPI | Yes | Headlines; free tier: 100 req/day |

## Local env

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add keys for local testing.

## Deploy

Upload the built files to Dreamhost (or pull from GitHub after the daily run). The `index.html` and `data/` folder are generated by the build.
